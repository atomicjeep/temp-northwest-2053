<h1>National Wellbeing Service</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
The ‘National Wellbeing Service’ scenario imagines a future where the systems of health and social care have become integrated into one wellbeing system. It describes a world where personal responsibility for health and care, family and community is accepted by the wider public. There is no stigma for people seeking social or medical care, everyone needs different things at different points of life. Most services are integrated and local through Wellbeing Hubs.
</p>
<p>
Since the 2020 pandemic, and from a young age, people are taught about their responsibility to look after their minds and bodies. This is a future where people are included in shaping the services that support them in their lives. They feel their voice is heard and they are valued. Many of the older population in the South West enjoy the positive aspects of older age. Acute and emergency medicine are managed as a separate service.
</p>
<h2>What will it be like in 2035?</h2>


<ul>

<li>The majority of the population in the South West will be taking responsibility for their own mental and physical health.

<li>Public health will drive everything through the South West Wellbeing Service - protection, prevention, public confidence.

<li>Prescription (online) yoga, health coaches, counselling and other personalised therapies will be freely available from the NHS to the South West population.

<li>One-stop shop community health hubs will be available across the South West. These partner with health (including GPs), social work, voluntary and private providers to provide high-quality services such as diagnostics, prevention, rehabilitation, and minor care.

<li>There will be a network of residential and nursing care facilities linked to the community hubs, which will also offer step-up and step-down facilities (beds) to enable recovery on discharge from acute services.

<li>Acute and emergency services will be in regional specialised units with relationships to other regional specialisms as needed. A new national acute service will be in place, managed through a national network and a new Government department called ‘Heroes’, as distinct from the wellbeing service which is led locally through a consortium of Place based stakeholders.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A view from 2035</h2>


<p>
<strong>Today in 2035 </strong>a strong community spirit around health and wellbeing has emerged across the South West. Emerging from a decade-long series of radical reforms of services to improve, maintain and restore the health of individuals and communities, Prevention, Protection and Public confidence have become the watchwords. Over ten turbulent years the 20th century National Health Service has slowly given way to a 21st century National Wellbeing Service.
</p>
<p>
The relationship between service users and service providers swung from the dependency dynamic of the early 2020’s which had an over reliance on services servicing illness to the opposite extreme of independence and self-reliance by the late 2020’s. This swing of the pendulum had its own pitfalls in terms of undiagnosed illness and safety. However, by 2035 this dynamic has now settled into a more realistic relationship between people and services, characterised by a model of interdependence in which people, communities, and the state work together to maximise wellbeing in communities.
</p>
<p>
In 2025, a range of new wellbeing Hubs were created across the South West for clinicians, social care staff, volunteers, and families. These hubs were created to provide advice on self-care and personal resilience and to help staff to recognise their own ‘warning signs’ of mental ill-health.
</p>
<p>
Following the Covid-19 pandemic public inquiry of 2022, there was more of an acceptance and appetite from the public to take more responsibility for their own health. A rebalancing of rights and responsibilities led the public to see health and wellbeing as a key lifestyle pursuit.  The Inquiry exposed serious flaws with the decision-making processes through which the pandemic was handled at pivotal moments throughout 2020 and 2021.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The long-term MH consequences of the pandemic amongst both the health and care workforce and the general public have been addressed as a policy priority since 2022. As a result, the spectre of a post-Covid MH Pandemic has been, to a large extent, mitigated.
</p>
<p>
‘Stories of Covid’, a campaign by the BBC to highlight the impact of Moral Injury and PTSD in the workforce, led to the <strong><em>‘National Covid-19 Recovery and Restoration Hearings </em></strong>(CRRHs) of 2022-2023. These allowed health and social care staff, individually and collectively, to give voice to the trauma of the UK’s covid pandemic and to distill learning for the future. In the South West, local and regional CRRHs enabled staff holding unresolved feelings and trauma from the experience of 2020/21 to be heard as a way to support recovery as a shared societal activity. A collective sense of restoration was experienced and the narrative of Covid as a period of psychological growth as much as trauma became a shared framing of the covid years.
</p>
<p>
As a result of the National CRRH, individually tailored wellbeing programmes were mandated and funded for every NHS and social care organisation. In the South West these were embedded in annual appraisals such that by 2035 there is an accepted and personalised focus on staff wellbeing across all organisations.
</p>
<p>
A new political narrative was quickly adopted in the early 2020s with political and health leaders beginning to truly grapple with a regional health system that really encompassed the improvement of the social, economic, and environmental conditions in people’s lives.  As early as 2023, the South West set in place plans to ensure that every person in the region and every health worker had healthcare information to protect their own health and the health of those for whom they were responsible.
</p>
<p>
Today, hundreds of organisations, some online and many physical centres can be found around rural (and urban) communities across the South West, offering a range of health services - and the appetite is huge. The shift in thinking from the NHS as a service-based organisation to community anchor organisations have led to a complete rethink of NHS estate and purpose including the adaptation and selling of large, unfit for purpose buildings to resource new integrated community wellbeing centres. These community hubs maximise the use of technology to increase productivity and keep human resources costs to a minimum. Prescription (online) yoga, health coaches, counselling and other personalised therapies are freely available to anyone who wants them in the South West.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The private sector, through industry bodies, commit to being partners in the Community Hubs, investing business resources in shared wellbeing activities for employees as citizens. The prized, Annual Community Partner (ACP) Award given to industry partners involved in Community Hubs, grew out of a post pandemic collective commitment to rebuild the economy through rebuilding health. The ACP Award was initiated in the South West Region and was taken up as a national award in 2035. The first national award ceremony was held in Taunton, hosted by the Taunton Community Hub where the idea was first piloted.
</p>
<p>
Public confidence is high, and people feel empowered and in control of their own health and wellbeing. Technology plays a massive part in this. Accident and emergency doctors regularly consult specialists out of hours via video link. As well as potentially saving lives, this cuts staffing costs and ends the front door/backdoor dilemmas that beleaguered pre and post pandemic integrated care strategies. Arguments over responsibility for unscheduled care have become a thing of the past, replaced by a more responsive and collective community prevention approach which reduces illness and interrupts the cycle of crisis management that crippled the health and care system of the early 2020’s.
</p>
<p>
Schools have been a hugely important influence in this seismic shift. As far back as 2021, schools in the South West set about supporting children, young people and their families to deal with the effects of the great pandemic. Leaders took their chance to reform the school experience to support pupils. Today, from primary and secondary school, there is a focus on creating environments that encourage wellbeing, and - along with this emphasis - developing the kind of analytical and empathetic skills, and emotional intelligence, that are impossible to ‘automate away’. Pupil wellbeing - both physical and mental health - is prioritised above all else, and pupils are encouraged to pursue their own interests in creative ways, with less focus on rigid curriculums. A decade on, across the South West, we are reaping the benefits with an innovative young workforce who want to stay in the South West and build a healthy future for themselves and their wider community. The local food production, leisure and tech services industries are three significant areas of economic growth in the South West that have stimulated wellbeing and integration across numerous indicators.
</p>
<p>
In 2032, Edward Hyde, the newly appointed Mayor, declared the South West as the first region in England to be smoke free, with less than 5 percent of the population choosing to smoke tobacco. Of course, there are some in society who refuse to give up unhealthy lifestyles, giving rise to less tolerance and a lack of empathy for those perceived to have brought ill health upon themselves.
</p>
<p>
Self-management is central to reducing the need for health care services, particularly in the traditional acute hospital sector where unit costs are high. Now, user friendly personal monitors and new technologies allow many patients to manage their conditions at home and facilitates seamless transitions between hospital and home and supported by new self-assessment and trusted assessor (for specialist assessments) approaches.
</p>
<p>
More than 80% of those deemed to need care or support receive it in their homes from a range of professionals, but mostly from new health and social care practitioners (HSPs), who, as part of a multidisciplinary team, keep colleagues in the loop on how patients are doing. Information transfer and communication has become the number 1 priority for Multidisciplinary teams leading, in 2030, to the establishment of a new ‘Wards on the road” model to support coordination of care and handover. In 2030 the reference to ‘wards’ was acknowledged as a bridging term between the previous hospital-based model of care and the new community-based model of care. In 2035 this language is now subject to review, as confusion between Place based ‘wards’ and the now less familiar hospital ‘wards’ begins to sidetrack staff who report lack of clarity about the purpose of the communication model. This in itself is seen as an indicator of transition from hospital and service-based mindsets to community and Place based mindsets and staff-side representatives raising the confusion, themselves locate this in a positive change indicator.
</p>
<p>
Increasing workloads mean that these new peripatetic HSPs often end up working longer hours than they are paid for or have to leave without finishing some of their tasks to the detriment of the person they are supporting. This is mitigated for many staff by the new workforce schemes, established post covid, that recognise ‘effort’ alongside ‘targets’. These have had a significant motivating influence on staff who, following the collective burnout of the covid years have reconnected to their own personal purpose as care providers and who feel valued and rewarded by both their employers and the public for the role they play in wellbeing.
</p>
<p>
Today in 2035, supporting communities to act themselves, for example through community navigators and driving social prescribing, there is now an emphasis on self-assessment for staff and technology enabled portals in IT systems connecting service users, patients and professionals and the evidence is emerging that Integrated Teams produce better wellbeing and more resilient staff, who risk share and mitigate risk together.
</p>
<p>
The need for high speed broadband services across the South West to support virtual communication and hand overs led to investment in IT infrastructure and resources in South West communities and with an upswing in connectedness, quality of life and career opportunities in the Wellbeing sector, recruitment to professional roles is at an all-time high in the South West.
</p>
<p>
A study carried out by researchers at the University of Exeter based on early pilot schemes concluded that while a small number of older people were naturally resistant to mobile care (Mcare).  Self-management had the potential to save millions of pounds through reduced hospital admissions and other interventions. Each year more progress is made and risks mitigated by community navigators and community champions who have enabled digital use and reduced digital disadvantage.
</p>
<p>
Over the last decade there has been a seismic shift to proactive, social and preventive models of care rather than reactive and medical models - guided by universal care for all, a new shared purpose for wellbeing is held across all stakeholders in the South West. With growing knowledge of what wellbeing means, communities now enjoy personalised care and support planning is now at the heart of all decision-making in the South West.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The old philosophical and mindset tensions which, since the inception of the NHS in 1947, had regularly impacted on ambitions for transformation are now a thing of the past. There is a shared understanding that wellbeing is more about preventing illness and promoting good health and less about reducing use of services. Health coaching, self-management education and access to peer support with the community have been key to driving this shift.

        -   	 
</p>
<p>
In a speech given to the system leadership conference in 2034 by <em>Nasim Salatian, </em>Head of the South West’s Wellbeing Service, he said:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<em>“Today, when we talk about ‘systems’ we have a shared understanding that what we mean is ‘Systems of people and Place’ <strong>not </strong>‘service systems”</em>
</p>
<p>
<em> </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Organising resources and strategies around service delivery is now frowned on as an outdated, selfish and cruel approach. Systems of people and Place is embedded in all our strategies for Place”.</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The pioneering work of Bristol City to <em>‘Reimagine Place in the 21 Century’</em> has led to all health and social care activities happening under the umbrella of <strong><em>‘Our Place’ </em></strong>and happen in our homes, community settings, businesses and public service centres.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Following, what was termed at the time,' the death of the high street' in 2020/21 new models of cities and towns began to be reimagined across the South West with the mixed use of residential and commercial centres, local well-being centres, areas designed for the safe use of prams and frames prioritised rather than cars in planning.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Acute health needs are addressed through the newly established <strong><em>Acute Care Centres (ACC’s)</em></strong> which has been set up and invested in by a collaboration between Govt, scientists and Industry to acknowledge the importance and distinctiveness of treating medical conditions differently from social and wellbeing conditions.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
In 2035, there is a shared recognition of the 30/70 % distinction in medical and social determinants of Health, first researched by Sir Michael Marmot in 2020.<strong> <em>Acute Care Centres a</em></strong>re in their infancy and in addition to infrastructure transitions to move wellbeing activities and equipment into the community, there is an ongoing change and transition programme to help staff and the public make the mindset shift to a wellbeing model of care rather than the medical model of care which the whole population had internalised from the inception of the NHS.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Hospital estates are no longer totemic symbols of health care and instead our old NHS estates have begun a 20-year programme of redevelopment built on the approach taken to the restoration of heavy industry estates across the United Kingdom and Europe where redundant industrial plants are converted into conservation and leisure areas.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Acute Care Centre work takes place in specialist regional units such as emergency units, cardiology and ICU and the bitterly fought debates about which specialism goes to which area was resolved when South West Ambulance Service proposed a radical initiative for their role in enabling Place and Wellbeing initiatives. From 2035 transport services are split into two service areas - the transfer of patients to ACCs and the transfer of staff to community wellbeing locations (which may be in people’s homes). This builds on the work of paramedics working collaboratively with social care and other teams to ensure rapid enablement at home for people at risk of escalating into an acute admission.  
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
In fifteen short years we have witnessed a massive shift in the balance of medical and social paradigms and therefore of resourcing. There is a clearer and more realistic distinction in terms of resourcing and mindset between the medical model that sits beneath acute and emergency medicine and the social model of health that sits beneath the wellbeing model.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The 2028 Act of Parliament (Bill of health) set out a vision for the new National Wellbeing Service, with a clear distinction between acute and emergency health services and Population wellbeing. In this radical but reality-accepting Bill, the balance of Health resourcing and activity was set at 30/70 % medical and social support bringing Michael Marmot’s ratio of the causes of ill health formally into line with policy. (Previously, 70% of the cases of ill health were the result of social determinants but 30% of Health Funding was given to social determinants. This changed to 70% funding for social determinants and 30% for purely medical issues).
</p>
<h2>The role of leadership</h2>


<p>
In 2035 leaders are recruited, trained and rewarded for collaborative practices and for demonstrable commitment to social change ambitions. Promotion of medical illness service models of care are seen as very outdated. Leaders are expected to manage personal and professional ambitions in line with Wellbeing programme objectives, competition is now reframed as a resource for collaboration and innovation rather than professional or personal rivalry; system leadership has replaced hierarchical leadership as the cultural norm in wellbeing services.
</p>
<p>
Leadership is recognised as something that happens at all levels in a hierarchy and across organisations, communities and within families.  Senior leaders in any remaining hierarchical organisations now expect to work in multiple leadership domains and can move between hierarchical and collaborative roles easily, in order to accommodate matrix leadership and social system contexts. The 2021 Health and Social Care white paper set the scene for far reaching legislative changes in governance and commissioning arrangements.  There has been a radical shift from the culture of competition established by the 2012 Lansley reforms and today, new legal frameworks shore up a collaborative model of partnership in local systems. Governance arrangements have been reset as system accountabilities with a focus on population health and community resilience. The new legislative frameworks have placed NHS and local authority organisations into collaborative units in regional as well as local Place based systems and, unlike previous reforms, the 2021 reforms took account of the variability in the English system and legislated for decisions to be made by local system leaders. This has worked well for the SW as leaders were encouraged to build on historical partnership arrangements to embed a culture of collaboration across the workforce and in partnership with patients and communities.  
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Financial incentives in the latter half of the 2020’s boosted the development of joint budgets and collaborative commissioning which rapidly became the default approach to commissioning and delivery. This created a shift in expectations about shared ways of working that in turn led to a new normal of collaborative practice and cross system mindsets. The more direct “hands on” role proposed for the secretary of state for H&SC in the 2021 white paper enabled the government to build on the experience of covid to work more collaboratively with local government and NHS partners to connect local and national agendas. Implementation plans and system change ambitions today are the subject of creative inquiry and negotiation rather than imposed, one size fits all models. Today, final decision making about SW issues is left in the hands of local system leaders and is underpinned by a mindset of partnership and shared ownership of outcomes.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Resources for the development of leaders are targeted at this cross-system leadership community. Siloed leadership development activity is no longer funded and clinical leaders are now routinely trained alongside managerial and civic leaders as a way to develop shared understanding and broader perspectives about the complexities of care needs. Cultures of mutuality are embedded in all OD work with a view to embedding relationships in cross system groups rather than professional groups.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Patient leadership, user led and community leadership are now promoted as a valuable resource for decision making at the level of individual care and also at the level of strategic planning and system decision making.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Opportunities for leadership development for people with lived experience are central to all leadership development and OD strategies and all leadership development programmes include participants with lived experience as members of the cross-system group. The insights and relationships formed in integrated development programmes mean that today, leaders with lived experience are welcomed and valued partners within mainstream system partnership arrangements.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Providers of professional and organisational development are no longer attached to NHS bodies and have shifted beyond the domain of Health orientated think tanks. New community focused arrangements have emerged to support the development of leadership for wellbeing across the community, including the new Prince William Foundation for Community Wellbeing. The Foundation works with health and care professionals alongside diverse community leaders and sport leaders to promote a model of civic health and wellbeing in which mental, physical, social and economic health are positioned as the 4 pillars of Britain for the future. As the New Prince of Wales, William has used the financial legacy bequeathed to him on the death of Queen Elizabeth in 2027 to set up this Foundation. This has released a wave of patriotism for the Wellbeing Narrative, similar to the post World War II recovery narratives and the South West has bought into this ambition as a driver for change across the region.
</p>
<h2>Being a patient in the South West in 2035</h2>


<p>
Josh is 3 and lives in Gloucestershire. Three months ago, after a bout of flu, his Mum suspected that something was amiss. She remembered hearing at the Wellbeing Hub that children who wet the bed, are constantly thirsty, and feel tired a lot of the time could be showing signs of Type 1 Diabetes and should have their blood glucose levels checked. She phoned 111, and after a phone consultation an ambulance car arrived at the house within an hour with a diabetes nurse as the passenger. It was a good spot, the nurse tells Josh’s Mum, his blood sugar levels are over 20. It looks like Josh has Type 1 diabetes. They all go off to hospital as paediatric type 1 diabetes assessment is still an acute service.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The Diabetes Group who met at the Wellbeing Hub were great, especially in those early days. They offered the family face-to-face emotional and practical help, along with a nutritionist who helped educate them on how best to balance food and insulin requirements. It was all made much easier with diabetes nurses also located at the Hub and they monitor Josh’s HbA1c levels. In three months, Josh has only been at the specialist Diabetes Unit in hospital once, when he was first diagnosed and treated. All of Josh’s data is automatically uploaded to the wellbeing hub where his management is remotely monitored.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
He’s doing well, the family have been on a supported learning journey and have taken responsibility with self-management and have become expert ‘carb counters’. Josh’s diabetes management is so good, in discussion with the family, he is now being recommended for a free NHS closed loop insulin pump, before he starts nursery, something the family wanted and pushed for. Josh’s older sister, his friends, cousins and wider family wanted to be a part of Josh’s diabetes journey and took part in many of the families and friends sessions set up by the Wellbeing Hub. This led to many of Josh’s immediate circle reviewing their lifestyle and attitude to wellbeing. As a family they joined a community food growing group and the cousins meet weekly on their allotments to grow vegetables for their wider family.
</p>
<h2>Workforce profile</h2>


<p>
<strong>Total workforce size in 2035: 377,000. </strong>The overall size of the health and social care workforce has grown by over a quarter in the decade prior to 2035, with the South West Wellbeing Service by far the region’s single biggest employer. However, improvements in personal health have led to a relatively smaller proportion of staff working in acute care services, with the fastest growth occurring in social care and new wellbeing-oriented roles and in the independent and voluntary sector.
</p>
<p>
In 2025, the South West 10-year regional economic development Plan was aligned with a drive for recruitment in the South West Wellbeing Service and wider wellbeing industries. Incentives for new startups, school and college based schemes and talent management pathways based on the Alaskan Nuka model were developed for rural South West communities. These incentives were used to subsidise training in wellbeing skills to support career change for adults, and new legislation to promote higher pay and attractive employment conditions for wellbeing staff has led to a thriving recruitment sector and a competitive pool of potential employees. A positive cycle of recruitment, retention and wellbeing has now replaced the cycle of workforce shortages, reliance on agency staff and safety issues that dominated workforce strategies in previous decades.
</p>
<h3>Fastest growing health and social care occupation</h3>


<p>
<strong>Health and Social Care Practitioner</strong> <strong>(78% increase since 2025). </strong>The rapid integration of health and social care has led to the vast majority of care workers joining the South West Wellbeing Service to be employed as Health and Social Care Practitioners, a role which combines the more traditional responsibilities of a care worker with an increased focus on proactive, wellbeing-oriented care - for example, the provision of prescription health coaching to those who request it. Health and Social Care Practitioners, therefore, make up a highly agile workforce: they are at the heart of turning the far-reaching vision and aspirations of the South West Wellbeing Service into reality, requiring a willingness to adapt to the ever-more diverse wellbeing-related needs of the South West’s population.
</p>
<h3>Other key trends</h3>


<p>
The strength of the post-Covid societal agenda focused on improving wellbeing, and the pivotal role of regional Wellbeing Services in delivering this agenda, have helped build the perception of the South West Wellbeing Service as being a highly desirable place to work amongst most of the public. Indeed, successive governments’ willingness to back up this agenda with increased levels of investment - reflected in the rising pay levels of health and social care staff - have helped make a career in health and wellbeing a particularly attractive option for young people. Amongst young people, the sense that a career in the Wellbeing Service is both worthwhile and relatively materially rewarding has been reinforced both by the focus on wellbeing in schools and colleges in the post-pandemic years and by the dwindling of opportunities in other areas such as the retail sector.
</p>
<p>
The overall effect of these trends has been an increasingly youthful health and social care workforce, in which any staffing or skills shortages that arise can be reliably filled from the pipeline of passionate and dedicated student wellbeing workers coming out of the region’s colleges and universities.
</p>
<h2>Staff survey results</h2>


<ul>

<li>62% of staff are satisfied with their level of pay (up from 38% of NHS staff in 2019.)

<li>11% of staff report feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the past 12 months (40% in 2019).

<li>92% of staff feel that their manager takes a positive interest in their health and wellbeing (70% in 2019).

<li>4% often think about leaving their organisation (28% in 2019).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact of Brexit on the workforce</h2>


<p>
The short-term impact of Brexit was to intensify the staffing shortages experienced by services in the immediate post-pandemic period. In 2022 and 2023, a ‘Brexit effect’ deterring EEA workers from wanting to move to the UK - combined with continuing, stringent travel restrictions on the many parts of the world where the vaccine had not reached enough people to bring about herd immunity - severely limited the extent to which services were able to recruit from overseas.
</p>
<p>
Since then, however, the negative impacts of Brexit in this regard have been increasingly mitigated. Firstly, the growing coalescence around the idea of wellbeing as a core new national priority, especially evident in the education system, began to have a clear impact: much larger numbers of young people actively sought out careers in health and social care, having a noticeable impact on the size of the workforce from the mid-2020s onwards. Secondly, as the course of Britain’s regionalist, investment-led and wellbeing-oriented political trajectory became clear over the mid-2020s, the Brexit effect which had deterred EEA workers from migrating here even before any new restrictions took effect gradually started to wear off. After the UK moved to a new, closer long-term footing in its relationship with the rest of Europe by taking up EEA membership on a ‘Norway-plus’ basis in 2028, numbers of Europeans coming to work in the South West’s health and social care services began to increase more rapidly, and have now almost recovered to pre-2016 levels.
</p>
<h2>The role of clinicians</h2>


<p>
Clinical teams in 2035 are set up as collaborative, multi-disciplinary teams, with an emphasis on shared accountability and decision making in relation to patient care and service development. Nurse Leaders and Allied Health professionals work alongside medical colleagues in a non-hierarchical team arrangement with decision making held collaboratively and in relation to wellbeing outcomes rather than professional hierarchies. The MDT hosts a range of clinical specialists under the leadership of a Chief Wellbeing Officer who reports directly to the South West Board. In terms of governance, Medical Directors, Nurse Directors and operational Directors including the Chief Executive Officer, all report to the Chief Wellbeing Officer and performance measures are based on wellbeing outcomes and partnership working. Professional interests, reflected in traditional Royal Colleges and Associations, have been replaced with Wellbeing Bodies in which membership is determined by collective interest and wellbeing specialism rather than clinical training.
</p>
<ul>

<li>Lead Clinicians and Doctors are expert in converting initiatives that have been researched elsewhere and incorporating them into their working practices.

<li>There is an emphasis on using data to support resource management at a community level, requiring increased resilience to support patients who may have more difficulty accessing services.

<li>Doctors are experts in rapid decision making. Resource constraints and risk management inform which diagnostic tests are undertaken. The doctor is placed in a greater position of decision making with fewer opportunities to test and sense check.

<li>Lead Clinicians and Doctors need to consider the impact on wider society as part of the clinical judgement.

<li>Medical training for doctors now includes mandatory placements in community development settings, Wellbeing Hubs and in private industry to ensure the development of doctors as well-rounded citizens.

<li>We see a greater emphasis on the volume of data being used to harness more time to care, and supporting the continued development of patient experts.

<li>The ethical reasoning behind undertaking research plays a major role and is clearly demonstrated to patients. The interest lies in the mental health and well-being of the patient, throughout the research process and beyond. Patients are educated to use the available data to manage their own care where possible.

<li>With an abundance of data, areas of research and innovation are relatively easy to identify. Innovation is business as usual with technological advances making it easier to adapt.

<li>Remote learning and simulation-based training features highly.

<li>There is a greater emphasis on retention in the South West and promoting more flexible working patterns as an incentive to retain staff.

<li>All professionally qualified clinicians have a responsibility to be ‘fit for work’, as set out in the Care Act of 2028 and support is available to reduce instances of burnout, such as enforced breaks, reducing the number of clinical hours for more intense roles, increased peer support, support for doctors living, for example, on call accommodation to reduce travel time.

<li>Doctors are likely to have a greater influence in the education, training and building of the MDT.

<li>Clinical leadership is now mandatory as part of the clinician's role and forms part of every performance appraisal.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Treadmill Heath and Care System</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
<em>The Treadmill Health and care System describes a future based on ever-increasing need being put on the NHS and ever-decreasing funding being available. Staff are being expected to do ever-more with ever-less simply to stand still and maintain safe levels of service and care. The public have allowed this to happen, and politicians have failed to act. Since the Covid pandemic of 2020/21 the public have demanded more investment into the NHS system to try to ensure provision, but the reality is that consecutive reforms have failed to address the underlying issues.</em>
</p>
<h2>What will it be like in 2035?</h2>


<ul>

<li>Years of increased demand and decreased relative funding will lead to the NHS being unable to offer acceptable standards of care to all.

<li>Integration of health and social care will fail to produce a responsive care system in the South West

<li>Those relying on the NHS will not be able to access many services locally and will be expected to travel or use slow and outdated technologies.

<li>The NHS workforce in the South West will be understaffed and many local services have closed in recent years.

<li>Significant demand for staff support will be needed to manage the MH pandemic of covid and post-covid unmet demand leading to 90% of NHS resources being spent on staff.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A view from 2035</h2>


<p>
<strong>Today in 2035</strong>, many commentators report that the NHS workforce feels betrayed. After the great Pandemic Public Inquiry of 2022, political promises were made to invest in the NHS which did not materialise. Instead, NHS services began to be dismantled because of funding shortfalls which have impacted significantly on staffing levels. There are few incentives to retain specialist consultants locally with the best being recruited to National Centres of excellence and Big Pharma. The export of clinical specialists to the US (the UK’s primary health partner post Brexit) has left the specialist workforce in the SW depleted and recruitment and retention are now regular critical agenda items for system leaders.  There are few specialist centres and large hospitals in the South West anymore and people have to travel great distances for specialist care.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The promises of politicians and health chiefs to work closely with clinicians and other health professionals to identify ways to reduce duplication in how clinical services are delivered translated into deep cuts. Sweeping changes have been made to criteria for access to services in both physical and mental health services. Psychological services are reduced to acute admissions and containment therapies only with a return to 1950s style institutionalised care for large swathes of the South West population. Talking therapies have become the domain of private therapists and regulation of therapists is now voluntary following the unmanageable increase in individual therapists setting up as sole traders in the aftermath of the cuts to MH services. As a consequence, suicide rates are at an all-time high and the newly established suicide service set up in 2030 to cope with the demand from individuals and families affected by suicide is now overwhelmed. Mental distress is a ticking time bomb for UK society and as a predominantly rural community, the South West Suicide Service has lost track of wider community needs and become focused on Bristol and Plymouth communities only.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Musculoskeletal service demand is at an all-time peak and the cut off point for any diagnostic intervention is age 35. GPs are now required to refer over 35s to private sector consortiums of physiotherapists and osteopaths and many larger employers have developed in house deals with private sector providers as a way to mitigate impact on workforce capacity. Beyond large employers, those with private resources pay for their treatment whilst the majority of people with MSK conditions self-medicate with a range of painkillers and steroid treatments available from online pharmacies.
</p>
<p>
The largely successful economic growth targets for the South West region have been neutralised by the soaring cost of care across all sectors and a financial zero-sum game has been declared by the South West Regional Office for Government. Successive breakdowns in relationship between system leaders charged with aligning economic and health agendas has contributed to the fragmentation of health and economic factors in the South West. This has shown up significantly in the leadership of local Alcohol Plans.
</p>
<p>
Despite liver disease now being the third largest cause of death in the South West, the development of the 2034 Bristol City Alcohol Plan marked an all-time low in South West integration relationships. On 25 March 2034, the Bristol Economic Wellbeing Board met in Room 1 of Bristol House to approve a £93 million Waterfront Bars and Restaurant proposal whilst at the same time, in Room 2, the Health and Wellbeing Board were signing off a £96 million pound rescue package for a new Liver Unit at Bristol Hospital.
</p>
<p>
The irony was not lost on community campaigners and a petition was launched by members of the former 2023 Collaborative Communities Forum, demanding that the two Boards meet to align objectives for the City’s Alcohol Plan. The petition did not receive enough signatures to be considered by officials and despite local efforts to mediate between the two Boards, their refusal to meet resulted in two competing strategies for Alcohol in the City being signed off. For political reasons, this was not addressed by the Regional Council in 2034 and today, in 2035 there is confusion and fragmentation at all levels of implementing the Alcohol Plan in Bristol, including different approaches to licensing regulations approved by each Board. Local families and individuals affected by addiction bear the cost of this breakdown of leadership. The Bristol example is indicative of the breakdown of system leadership relationships across the South West region.
</p>
<p>
The long-awaited reform of social care following the increased awareness of the interdependencies between hospitals and nursing homes has led to an increasingly medicalised approach to care of the elderly. Care homes now fall under the remit of the Director of Nursing and every South West hospital now has a Care Dependency Unit (CDU) with limited bed numbers available at any one time for admission. Staff are very stretched in managing this service and there is a constant conflict between NHS and local Government as to who pays for this service to the extent that in 2035 more money has been spent on Judicial reviews of elderly care in the South West than on the actual provision of care.
</p>
<p>
Palliative care is reduced to pain management with the 2020s criteria for Do Not Resuscitate stripped back to a Do Not Treat policy which is adhered to in every case admitted to the CDU. Staff burnout in elderly care is high and it is accepted that staff only work in this specialism for a few years. There is therefore little expertise being developed in elderly care interventions and this has become a Cinderella service in terms of R&D.  
</p>
<p>
There is an increasing move towards privatising end of life units as a way to manage demand for care in elderly populations. A confidential paper, drafted after secret discussions between the assisted suicide firm Clementia and the private health insurer BetterHealth facilitated by the UK Government, has been leaked to the press in summer 2035 as a strategy for managing winter pressures in 2036. The paper proposes a strategy for voluntary euthanasia to be available to the over 85s. The BMA ethics committee publicly commented on the leaked paper, saying now was the time to consider all humane options and that the Clementia model of compassion was highly regarded and should be considered as one option to meet the soaring demand in elderly care.
</p>
<p>
There is an increasing polarisation in the workforce between staff trained before 2020 and newly trained staff. Staff who were trained prior to the acute covid years continue to leave the service disillusioned or suffering from symptoms of moral injury, catalysed by their experience during the pandemic and the persistent retriggering that many experienced in the following years of poorly resourced recovery. Those who stay are characterised by cynicism, persistent resistance to change and apathy. Many talk about their purpose as one of staying to serve their pension; staff who express a purpose in relation to serving patients are now regarded as naive, dismissed as the ‘moral high horse brigade’ or the laughable ‘old guard’. A culture of distrust is embedded in the Service, with Trade Unions and Staff Side interventions a daily feature of management activity, leading to chronic delays in decision making, a rise in safety issues and an ever-present fear of litigation which cripple management resources and stifle innovation.
</p>
<p>
Newly trained staff have gone through a rigorous new curriculum designed around a minimalist health service with career progression rewarded for efforts in efficiencies and meeting targets for reducing patient usage of services. The NHS Graduate Trainee Scheme has replaced general manager training with management consultants training in a groundbreaking transfer of the much loved service scheme to the private sector.
</p>
<p>
The big three management consultants have competed for the past 10 years to deliver this lucrative 5-year training programme. The initial contract, awarded to the consultancy firm <em>Prospectum</em>, led to a root and branch reset of expectations for NHS managers which shifted the culture in South West NHS services to that of a business mindset and financial purpose.
</p>
<p>
This has been built on by subsequent providers and the NHS Grad scheme is now regarded as a world leading business training scheme. (The new contract for 2035-40 has been delayed in response to the expression of interest in running the scheme from two individual global entrepreneurs who have issued a legal challenge to the procurement process based on a proposal to extend the UK training programme to a global health workforce model).
</p>
<p>
Values Based Recruitment (VBR), an indicator of innovation, and ‘Good to Great’ staffing initiatives in the early 2020s have given way to Skill Based Recruitment (SBR), which focuses on technical and financial skill sets and privileges personality traits based on rational thinking, objectivity and emotional detachment. Congruence, empathy and integrity have been removed from NHS leadership and management frameworks and from NHS Assessment Centre criteria. ‘<em>To be human is to be a machine; to care is to be punished’</em> was the title of a suicide letter from an NHS Nurse who took her own life following her 6th clinical leadership application rejection. Her letter, sent to the online BMJ on the day of her death, documented years of systematic disinterest from South West NHS leaders and Regional Bodies. Disinterest in relation to the deterioration of care and humanity in the wards at her local hospital where financial efficiency and discharge were the determining factors in care choices, and where the needs of the patient had become, in her experience, a question that incurred managerial reprimand. There was a short-lived news interest in her story but this was overridden by the BBC breaking news event that leaked the hospital’s inclusion on the list for decommissioning hospitals in 2036 on the grounds of bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>
Integration has also failed to live up to the promises of a decade ago and the energy for transformation has been lost from the culture of system leadership.
</p>
<p>
The NHS and local government often find themselves in a struggle against one another when it comes to gaining influence and accessing resources. In 2035 we have a new shared purpose for leadership of integration in the South West public sector - resistance. We no longer pretend that integration is desirable and there is an open collusion, a Faustian pact, between different agencies that protecting siloes is important.  
</p>
<p>
The 10-year Plan for Places commissioned by the new Government in 2024 was written in the South West as a shared act of resistance to the imposition of National Government pronunciations on the nuances of South West identity. With National Government preoccupied with post covid recovery and public Inquiries, the 10-year plan was approved without much scrutiny and was mostly a rehash of old and contested differences from previous ICS and STP plans. As such it allowed for ten years of legitimised cross system competition and protection of silos in local systems. The revised plan of 2034 is today the subject of a judicial review, with legal action threatened to South West NHS Boards and the new South West Regional Council for failing to ensure integration of addiction services which have been deemed a Government priority for communities in 2035.
</p>
<p>
There is a Mental Health Pandemic in the general population following the impact of covid and the failure of successive governments to acknowledge and mitigate this.
</p>
<p>
The health and social care workforce are one group who have been hit particularly hard as the impact of moral injury from the covid experience and subsequent public inquiries about the role of government in key factors such as PPE and lockdown decisions reveal that more could have been done to prevent the high UK death toll. Key research findings in 2021/22 about the MH impact of covid on health and social care workforce were used as political footballs. This acted as an avoidance of confronting the unbearable reality of a health and social care community breaking down instead of a shared national response to the growing MH crisis. As a consequence, the workforce today is psychologically replete and demoralised. Addiction is high amongst clinicians and safety events are frequent and under monitored because of the volume of incidents. Occupational Psychology teams are overwhelmed and the 2020 focus on compassionate leadership has been replaced with a focus on dispassionate care as a means of staff survival.
</p>
<p>
Amongst the general public, demand for MH services is unsustainable and US style street scenes, prevalent a decade ago, are now commonplace with mentally ill and uncared for people sleeping rough, drinking on the streets. This huge volume of unmet need has had a knock-on impact on policing and prison services which are frequently overwhelmed in dealing with mental health needs.  Volunteer members of the public take on the mantle of care on the streets and at home as formal MH services crumble and are only able to deal with acute illness. Admissions to MH wards have increased, and there is a shift in policy to increase MH beds and reduce community treatments in favour of a community MH policy that is not well enough resourced or trained to cope with the volume and complexity of mild and moderate MH conditions that now dominate UK health profiles.
</p>
<p>
Homeless shelters and supported accommodation now only accept female residents in a vulnerability-based criteria that has also seen a 60% reduction in occupancy in 2035 compared to 2025. Winter deaths amongst homeless groups have soared since 2025 and annual temporary morgues to deal with winter mortality across the population have become the norm in 2035 - a familiar and accepted community reality since the covid third wave of Winter 2021.
</p>
<p>
Today, commissioning of services is no longer debated as an indicator of need. At best, today, commissioning of services is a financial exercise to ensure critical services can continue whilst demand is reduced for all other services. At worst it is a managerial and bureaucratic exercise to ensure that accountability for taxpayers’ money is maintained, prioritising staying in credit financially, with little reference to what is actually needed by patients and communities. Our last South West Integrated Care System Board in June 2035 was held as an emergency meeting following the Board’s Summer Report which showed a predicted overspend by £73.4 million in 2035, and the subsequent removal of the CEO and DOF from their roles. The meeting was attended by an NHSE turnaround CEO and interim DOF who gave assurances to the Board that a new regime was being put in place and that providers had been issued with new contracts and budget priorities for service delivery.
</p>
<p>
In 2019 The King’s Fund identified a large and growing gap between capacity and demand in district nursing services, with staff reporting feeling ‘broken’, ‘exhausted’ and ‘on their knees’. There was a 35 per cent reduction in health visitors in England’s NHS between 2015 and 2020 and a 38 percent decrease in learning disability nursing numbers between September 2010 and September 2019. These figures doubled between 2021 and 2024 with the result that community services were no longer a viable option, and vocational routes for staff became limited to general nursing roles with limited career specialisms and generic, ‘one size fits all’ services to patients.
</p>
<h2>The role of leadership</h2>


<p>
In 2035 leaders are recruited, trained and rewarded for stamina, ability to compromise and flexibility with values. The language of burden, crisis, control and efficiency dominate the South West leadership discourse; despite rhetoric to the contrary, managerialism is promoted above leadership and performance is measured by adherence to protocol, procedure and bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Leaders have consequently adopted an increasingly tight managerial approach, based on centralising work priorities and controlling activity as a way to manage change fatigue and unrest in the workforce. The proposed approach to compassionate leadership advocated by national experts at the Queens Fund (where autonomy, belonging and competence are valued) has been replaced by a new proposal in which rule compliance, working in professional units, rather than across teams and systems, and financial competence are most valued.
</p>
<p>
The unintended consequence of pressure by the central government means that work needs to be done at a higher level where people in leadership roles are more reluctant to change and politics comes into play. “We thought the politics issue should sort itself out when we formally integrated as there would only be one organisation and one board. But it didn't, it got worse”. This comment from the South West staff survey revealed the ongoing and now chronic problem with political maneuvering and organisational competition locally.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Clinical leadership is discouraged and clinical development is limited to medical specialism as needed. There is an emerging culture which views clinicians as an old elite who have been pampered and over invested in as a profession. In 2035 there is a South West approach to investing in managerial and operational leadership as a way to redress this perceived imbalance and to support achievement of performance objectives.
</p>
<p>
Turnaround leaders have evolved to become the most powerful leadership roles in the country. In the South West, ‘The Taunton Group’ as they have become known, are one of the most powerful Networks in the country and are regularly drafted in to sort failing systems across the UK. The Group is used as the benchmark for leadership attributes which include comfort with difficult conversations, assertiveness, single mindedness; the refusal to compromise and the promotion of public humiliation of managers as a performance motivator.
</p>
<p>
The Group cut its teeth on a seminal turn around process in Devon in 2029 where 2/3rds of the management team in each NHS organisation in the City were removed over a 2-month period. Recruitment giant Hart worked in partnership with NHS Providers and the Turnaround team to source a fully operational, international replacement management team within 6 weeks. Attractive salaries were offered to the new managers for an 18-month contract and when that ended in 2030 staff were let go and services were further centralised under super manager structures of 60 people to one line manager. The savings created by this Turnaround process were significant and a new model of Turnaround was written up by the Group in partnership with Ross Business school who came on board to deliver a ten-year contract for staff development based on this approach.
</p>
<p>
A new behavioural framework was developed by Ross in 2030, based on the capabilities and behaviors of the Taunton Group. This has been adopted by all NHS organisations as the benchmark for future leaders following a presentation to the Commons Health and Social Care Committee when it convened a special meeting to explore connecting Business agendas and Health agendas at the House of Lords in 2032.  
</p>
<p>
A study exposing bullying, incivility and corporate coercion in the NHS in early 2000’s was reframed in 2030 as constructive form of leadership based on assertive, commanding, and collective leadership. The experience of civil contingency measures during the pandemic highlighted the benefits of command and control leadership, such that collaborative and distributed leadership models became redundant in a culture that is now organised around financial efficiencies and management safety. Combined with the financial success of the Taunton Turnaround Group methods, this framing of leadership dominates assumptions and expectations of what is acceptable for leaders in 2035.
</p>
<p>
Access to personal development and leadership programmes in the South West is encouraged if recommended by your line manager but there is a three-year backlog of applications waiting for approval at the annual assessment meeting.
</p>
<h2>Being a patient in the South West in 2035</h2>


<p>
Josh is 3 and lives in Gloucestershire. Three months ago, after a bout of flu, his Mum suspected that something was amiss. Josh often wet the bed, was constantly thirsty, and was tired and irritable for weeks. Josh’s mum tried to arrange an appointment with the GP but the first emergency appointment was more than two weeks away. Josh’s Mum decided to take Josh straight to A&E. After a six hour wait, Josh was seen and after investigation it was discovered that Josh had suffered from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He remained in hospital for two weeks then was referred to the paediatric diabetes service.
</p>
<p>
Luckily for Josh and his Mum, the paediatric diabetes services for the South West is located within Gloucestershire so its relatively easy to get to appointments. Other families from Cornwall have to travel many miles across the region to access support. A diabetic nurse talks to Josh’s Mum and explains that training to manage Type 1 diabetes is largely undertaken through group work but there was none planned for the coming 6-8 weeks; that was dependent on staff being available and if a big enough group of people could be brought together in one place. That was difficult to arrange. In the meantime, a diabetic nurse would try to come out to their house to talk to the family but that might take some time. The best thing for now, the nurse explained, is to look online and wait for us to get to you to go through some training.
</p>
<p>
Josh’s mum feels left on her own to manage and is worried she doesn't have the skills or knowledge to keep Josh well.
</p>
<h2>Workforce profile</h2>


<p>
<strong>Total workforce size in 2035: 352,000. </strong>Overall staffing levels have increased by around a fifth since 2020 across all health and social care services. However, this represents a relative shrinkage given the much larger increase in the elderly population of the South West, causing demand for services to rise rapidly both in terms of complexity and in sheer scale.
</p>
<h3>Fastest growing health and social care occupation</h3>


<p>
<strong>NHS nurse (35% increase since 2025). </strong>Acute, hospital-based services have increasingly been prioritised as the maintain standards within funding realities, with aggressive recruitment drives taking place for extra NHS nurses in response to growing public outrage at growing waiting times for acute care. However, declining investment in preventative treatments and care has had the effect of driving demand for acute services higher still, meaning that there remains considerable reliance on agency and bank staff to complement this increased NHS nursing workforce.
</p>
<h3>Other key trends</h3>


<p>
One long-lasting consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic has been a rise in prominence of mental health as a key area of concern for health and social care services: both in terms of the enduring impacts of the lockdowns of 2020-21 on the wellbeing of the population as a whole, and more specifically with regards to the trauma felt by many of the health and social care workers who were at the front-line of the pandemic, which proved difficult for many staff to recover from.
</p>
<p>
In response to huge public concern regarding this issue, successive governments have put considerable resources towards helping the NHS deal with Britain’s mental health crises, which has mainly been manifested in the South West by a rapid rise in the numbers of mental health nurses. However, most of these additional mental health nurses find their jobs mostly taken up with addressing the symptoms of the mental health crisis, including rising numbers of people experiencing severe depression; across the health and social care system, overworked staff simply do not have sufficient capacity to undertake the kind of preventative action that could help address the root causes of the crisis.
</p>
<h2>Staff survey results</h2>


<ul>

<li>22% of staff are satisfied with their level of pay (down from 38% of NHS staff in 2019.)

<li>63% of staff report feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the past 12 months (40% in 2019).

<li>52% of staff feel that their manager takes a positive interest in their health and wellbeing (70% in 2019).

<li>48% often think about leaving their organisation (28% in 2019).

<li>15% feel valued for their work.

<li>25% believe they experience autonomy, belonging and purpose in their work (the three pillars of effective leadership established as a benchmark by the DH&SC following a report by Michael West in 2025 and still espoused as the system standard in 2035.)
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact of Brexit on the workforce</h2>


<p>
The short-term impact of Brexit was to intensify the staffing shortages experienced by services in the immediate post-pandemic period. By the end of 2022, however, the numbers of those leaving the workforce due to fatigue and stress became so large the UK Government instituted new incentives for non-British nationals to come and work for the NHS and in social care.
</p>
<p>
In particular, a new Immigration Health Payment of £800 was offered to all migrants who took up a position in health and social care within six months of moving to the UK. Moreover, with normal travel to the UK still suspended for the many parts of the world where Covid-19 continued to rage, the UK Foreign Office began running dedicated flights in early 2023 to transport health workers willing to move to the UK from countries including India and Nigeria. Full two-jab vaccination and paid-for hotel quarantining was provided for all migrating health and social care workers from countries where herd immunity from the virus had not yet been achieved.
</p>
<p>
By the early 2030s, workers from non-EEA countries make up around 15% of the South West’s health and social care workforce - around a doubling in this proportion since 2023. Staff remain so stretched despite this in part because of a long-term, continuing decline in the numbers of EEA migrants willing to come and work in a UK which by now has diverged from the EU quite dramatically with regards to key environmental, social and labour market standards: just 2% of NHS workers in the South West come from EEA countries by 2035 in this scenario, down from 5.5% in 2020.
</p>
<h2>The role of clinicians</h2>


<ul>

<li>Clinicians work hard to manage processes to ensure that certain groups are not excluded, by ensuring that the individual patient is kept at the centre.

<li>We see the emergence of health consumers, bringing new data and potentially privately purchased test data/results into their interactions with doctors. These make for more challenging interaction with patients when doctors haven’t previously seen them.

<li>There is more emphasis on a shared responsibility/ accountability and diminished, smaller teams making clinical judgements.

<li>Doctors have self-care deeply built into their training to combat the explosion in mental ill health in the profession.

<li>Overstretched doctors complain they cannot be expected to know the entire holistic view of an individual patient’s complexity. There remains a strong emphasis on supporting patients through shared decision making.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Two-Tier Health and Care System</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
The two-tier Health and Care System scenario describes the consequence of a decade of increased health, economic and social inequalities in the South West coupled with a surge in private health care provision through technology. Those with the means do well in this scenario. Those without must rely on an NHS that has been contracting for a decade through under investment and understaffing.
</p>
<h2>What will it be like in 2035?</h2>


<ul>

<li>Personalised care and treatments, specific to individuals, will be available through privatised genomic centres across the South West - for those who can afford it.

<li>Approaches such as whole genome sequencing, data and informatics, and wearable technology will be routinely used by private health care insurers and private health care providers.

<li>30 percent of the population of the South West - those without access to private healthcare - will totally rely on the National Health Service which is under resourced and understaffed in the South West

<li>A divergence of health outcomes will be clearly evidenced between those relying on National Health Services and those with access to advanced private health and treatment services.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A view from 2035</h2>


<p>
<strong>Today in 2035,</strong> the South West is divided across the fault lines of health, social and economic inequalities. In 2024, the Leader of the Opposition in a landmark speech in the Commons said,
</p>
<p>
<em>“...it's time to face facts. The NHS we once knew and loved is gone. Patients can no longer expect the same level of care from our NHS. Only those with money can afford good health! Year after year, we have seen a betrayal of ideals that underpinned our once great NHS. We no longer have fair and accessible health care ‘free at the point of delivery’.  Colleagues, The NHS has been privatised by the opposition benches...”</em>
</p>
<p>
Today, the 1947 NHS legacy of free healthcare for all at the point of delivery still exists but in a significantly watered-down version. A basic level of care and service provision is available free at POD but there are long waiting lists to access even basic consultations and emergency services are limited. To access quality care, diagnostics and specialist services people now have to pay either through a tiered system built into the NHS or directly through the private sector. Politicians, NHS leaders and private sector providers blame each other and have done so for a decade or more. Political promises following the great pandemic of 2021 vanished and recession after recession led to economic decline. Pension funds collapsed, taking away the retirement many in the South West had hoped for.
</p>
<p>
There have been years of underfunding in the NHS. Instead of direct investment, consecutive governments relied heavily on the private sector to invest in research, development and technology. After a time, governments could no longer afford the inflated prices of the private sector despite the combined buying power of the NHS to get commonly used products cheaper. The private sector began to dominate and by 2030 they had created a fully functioning private care system for those able to pay.
</p>
<p>
For those who have health insurance and can access the private care system in the South West, huge advances in pharmacogenomics allow doctors to target specific genetic / disease combinations with the most effective drugs. Gene-editing technologies have allowed some of the most intractable inherited genetic conditions to be treated.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
A digital health passport has become the primary source of access to services across the country and The South West Region has been an early adopter of the passport system, such that, by 2035 this is now firmly embedded as the sole mechanism for access to care.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
In 2035, there are currently two passport tiers.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<ul>

<li>The Tier A passport which is blue coloured and has a range of visa permits which can be purchased by individuals or through employee schemes to access a broad landscape of services ranging from physical care to high tech diagnostics and digital interventions. Access is granted through a personalised QR code available to buy directly from Health providers or through the burgeoning health insurance market. Gold standard passports are also available to buy from national and global health companies allowing patients to travel freely within the UK and international health economy, facilitating greater choice and access to specialist expertise.

<li>The Tier B passport which is red coloured and has access only to NHS and state provided services. There is no prioritisation of access in the Tier B passport system and access to all services is managed through a first come first serve basis. It is available for services within the South West region only.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
In 2035, NHS managers were instructed to stop annual planning cycles, previously used to ensure that service provision is available all year round. Instead today they are instructed to release new appointments and delivery schedules only at the start of each financial year and run services until the annual financial allocation has been used up. In 2034 many services were stood down in September when resources were used up. Today, in March 2035, waiting list demand has already exceeded the 2035 resource allocation and appointments are being scheduled for 2036.
</p>
<p>
Emergency services responded to the scheduling crisis by automatically referring critical patients, for example, from RTA’s and other immediately life-threatening incidents onto Tier A pathways to enable life-saving medical care. This has had a knock-on effect in the courts as reclaim departments set up new processes to legally address nonpayment. Today insurance companies are extending life insurance policies to include emergency care cover in the event of unexpected critical admission but those without cover now find their situation compounded by critical illness and a legal case for the care that saved their life.
</p>
<p>
Many staff, who were furloughed in September 2034 on a 20% salary retainer on condition they returned to the service in 2035, have now joined private sector healthcare bank teams and have mostly resigned from the NHS. Pockets of innovation in the NHS which ran out of funding in 2034 were bought up or otherwise acquired by the private sector in order to keep them running. These are now only available to Tier A passport holders.
</p>
<p>
The South West state healthcare system is at breaking point and is regarded as no longer viable. This has been raised in the House of Commons by the local MP and an inquiry into future viability of the NHS has been set up, led by Lord Bruce Swietek whose team have let it be known that the outcome is a foregone conclusion.
</p>
<p>
Reform of social services would mean more responsibility taken for the elderly by families and/or the community – where an old person has no support group and they become in need of residential care they would be taken into state care institutions. Stories leaked from these institutions are not good. The death rate is high from rampant infections which cannot be contained.
</p>
<p>
When an elderly person with no other support needs continuous health care they can only be admitted to a CDU (community hospitals are no longer available to the elderly).
</p>
<p>
The CDU is part of the basic NHS package so free. If you want a better level of care it's private and you pay. But they would only be admitted for a health issue once agreement / and or means to pay had been ascertained.
</p>
<p>
In order to deal with the range of health issues, patient behaviours and lack of staff, units would resort to mass sedation in order to manage.
</p>
<p>
Palliative care is reduced to pain management with the 2020’s criteria for Do Not Resuscitate stripped back to a Do not Treat policy which is adhered to in every case admitted to the CDU. CDUs have become synonymous in the community with transit lounges to the morgue, and generally speaking only those elderly people with no advocacy support or no personal resources are admitted. In the wake of a cry to avoid a return to a 19th century poorhouse scenario, the Insurance sector stepped in and a new insurance scheme for families with elderly relatives without financial resources has been set up to help meet the cost of private care. In 2035 the scheme is in its infancy and for those without private resources many older people are either admitted to the CDUs to die, or die alone, often forgotten and in pain.
</p>
<p>
Health brands closely associated with reputable ‘tech’ organisations have continued to grow and they have made their influence felt across the sphere of health and wellbeing in scores of Personal Medicine Centres across the South West. People go there to be ‘profiled’ and supported through life stages, prevention medicines, regular screening. This is a world apart from those reliant on the NHS.
</p>
<p>
Many affluent young people have not gone to ‘traditional universities’ to study, which have been dramatically devalued in recent years. They instead go, at a high cost, to highly sought after privately-run learning centres - funded by multinational insurance companies which prepare young people with the required, adaptive skills for a career in private health care. When they enter the high-end of the labour market, young people from more affluent backgrounds have more choice, in terms of sector and region. The South West is seen as a good place to locate with a good life and work balance.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Affluent young people looking to join the NHS are well rehearsed in the kinds of jobs which AI will create and which ones it will replace. Today in 2035, they are entering the world of work demanding a new deal from employers. They know that they have skills which are in demand in health care. The pace of change in AI technology has seen a burgeoning industry in postgraduate and professional development learning centres which have
</p>
<p>
At the fee-paying private schools across the South West, young people and their parents demand learning and tuition in computer science, software development and financial management. Soft skills are seen as important to the changing job market. Many young people aim to become self-employed and provide artisan bespoke services.
</p>
<p>
In the winter months, it is commonplace to see people struggling to get by queuing outside health centres in the South to receive the annual covid and flu vaccines.
</p>
<p>
The Third sector is increasingly marginalised as a peripheral provider of non-urgent services which are now, by and large, run as community volunteer schemes with little regulation of training to shore up the well-intentioned spare time activities of an increasingly time and money rich section of society.  
</p>
<p>
Some Third sector organisations have created a niche in the market as a cheap provider of complex care services, taking on the service demands that public sector organisations are no longer able to manage. Individuals with complex care needs and comorbidities are referred into these services as a first step in any assessment process.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Large Third sector provider consortiums are set up to gateway access to the healthcare market. These are managed by a South West Regional Programme Management Body (PMB) set up by a retired MacDonald Partner to coordinate and unify disparate third sector offers under one umbrella management company. The Third sector organisations who initially resisted this move to homogeneous management have now gone bust, as diverse sources of funding dried up in the early 2030s. The remaining providers are motivated by organisational survival in some cases and entrepreneurial zest in others who have entered the third sector space as a way to acquire less desirable services. The increasing distance between regulation and third sector provision means that quality and safety standards are now less important as an aspect of the work; a greater priority is now containing service users so that demand on public sector services is minimised and adhering to strict management procedures from the Programme Management Body in relation to budgets and accountability.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Rising inequalities across society at large are now perhaps most strikingly crystalised in the increasingly divergent life expectancies of people living in different parts of the South West. Within larger towns and cities such as Bournemouth, Plymouth and Bristol, life expectancy now varies by as much as ten years between poorer and more affluent postcodes; a 65-year-old woman living in mid-Devon or the Cotswold District, meanwhile, can expect to live for an additional twenty-four years based on local averages.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the data indicates that wealthier residents of the South West are now likely to enjoy some of the lengthiest lives in Europe. What’s more, health inequalities in 2035 manifest themselves in a highly visible way in the form of the wearable technology commonly sported by the affluent to enable the monitoring of key health indicators by their private insurers. Amongst the less well-off, this technology is frequently a cause for resentment and envy: many feel that if the NHS had the resources to offer this kind of data-driven monitoring and early-identification of conditions, their parents and grandparents would be able to live longer and more pain-free lives as well.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, it is increasingly difficult to ignore the considerable angst amongst the financially precarious majority of younger, working-age people with regards to these widening inequalities. The ironic hashtag #NationalWealthService frequently trends across social media when private providers feature in the news for one reason or another, or form a plot point in one of the UK’s popular live-streamed web-based soap operas. More dramatically, the slogan has on several occasions been found emblazoned in red graffiti across the windows of private provider BetterHealth’s Bristol headquarters, a common locus for protests and community organised demonstrations since its construction in late 2029.
</p>
<p>
However, discontent with health and social care services is far from limited to private providers. Indeed, even amongst many of the South West’s poorer residents in 2035, these companies are often seen as offering excellent and innovative services, which most would be happy to take advantage of if they had the means to do so. Rather, it is NHS and state provided social care services which often bear the brunt of popular discontent, whose overworked staff increasingly do not have the capacity to deliver a standard of care and service which members of the public feel they deserve.
</p>
<p>
Protests are a common occurrence in NHS health care settings, often community led with an increasingly well organised Civilian Protest Army acting as an unregulated force beyond the control of any political party. The group often appear to be verging on anarchy and are motivated by a sense of grievance and exclusion to take random but collective protest action. Leaders of the group are known to police and monitored by the newly established Health Crime Unit based at MI5 as a significant domestic terrorism threat.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
This collective rage also shows up in individual consultations with NHS service providers as anger at poor quality services spills over into the waiting room and consulting rooms. High levels of discontent from patients without resources for private care have built up over the past 5 years and have become a defining feature of the interaction between patients and service providers, culminating in 2030 in the high profile, public murder of a young doctor in the entrance of the South West State hospital. In response, military style security entrances are established in all South West service units by 2032. Services are now organised at scale and in centralised units as a way of managing security threats. Patients are required to prove their identity against an electronic appointment bar; their details are checked against a security database and everyone is body scanned before access is permitted.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Cars are no longer allowed within 300 metres of the security entrance and now have to park in a secure car park managed by a global security company. A pilot wheelchair transport scheme, has been set up by the now fully privatised South West prison service, using serving prisoners as the workforce in a highly acclaimed but controversial community rehabilitation venture.
</p>
<p>
The scheme has been rolled out in all South West care settings for people unable to walk from secure car parks to the hospital entrance. The cost of wheelchair transport is high and patients are nervous about being transported by serving prisoners. As a consequence service demand has been successfully reduced in most settings by 2035 and a contract has been awarded to the South West Prison Service for national roll out to all UK health care settings as an exemplar of service innovation.  
</p>
<p>
The migration of more affluent citizens towards private services, meanwhile, has had the effect of gradually diminishing the salience of NHS funding as a crucial issue in determining voter behaviour and satisfaction with the government. Indeed, across many South West seats such as Stroud and Gloucester, a growing plurality of the governing parties support base uses private insurance; as they do not tend to come into contact with the NHS, issues such as lengthening waiting times for non-urgent treatment are simply not as high up the priority list for these voters as in decades past.
</p>
<p>
This has caused many leaders in the sector to worry that future politicians will feel even less constrained in diverting further resources away from statutory health and social care services. Some are concerned that we have now entered a vicious circle: underfunding of public healthcare caused standards of care to decline, pushing more South West residents towards private provision; which in turn decreases the salience of NHS funding as a political issue, paving the way for further cuts to take place.
</p>
<h2>The role of leadership</h2>


<p>
In 2035 leaders are recruited, trained and rewarded for two different industries:
</p>
<ul>

<li>The state NHS system which has replaced the 2020 health and social care system as a low paid, undervalued, second rate career option.  

<li>The private sector which is characterised by a heroic, fast paced and innovative culture where fortunes can be made and awards for new digital solutions are sought after as personal and collective kitemarks
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the state sector, South West health leaders are now primarily managers, responding to centrally determined strategies to be implemented at local level. Clinicians are no longer members of the leadership and management teams in the South West and a separate clinical development programme is run by the private sector to upskill clinicians in digital and technical capabilities.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The state NHS leadership framework has been pared back to five key competencies:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Financial and business management</strong> with a performance emphasis on balancing budgets, reducing service demand and creating financial and human resource surpluses where possible.

<li><strong>Crisis management</strong> this is prioritised along with financial and business management as the top core competence for NHS leaders today. The covid pandemic spawned a plethora of research into crisis management in the Health care system and today, all development programmes are underpinned by these competencies. The British Army logistics and emergency response Units have developed a model of Crisis management in partnership with the UK Maxwell Group and UWE have adapted this for a South West leadership programme to equip NHS leaders to deal with any crisis. Influencing skills and negotiation in the context of crisis are foundation level leadership capabilities, particularly with the workforce and with wider healthcare stakeholders such as the private sector who may be able to support.

<li><strong>Digital and Technical awareness</strong> with an emphasis on future scanning capabilities to spot digital care solutions and trends that can ease demand and enable health care can be managed at home rather than in collective centres such as hospitals.

<li><strong>Personal safety and wellbeing</strong> with a focus on personal safety awareness, personal resilience and strict adherence to 35 hour week contracts as the compassionate way to manage overwhelming workloads and performance demands.

<li><strong>Estate and Security management</strong> most NHS Estate is now outsourced to private Facilities Management companies. This competency is about relationship management with FM companies to ensure that NHS Estate is efficiently maintained and that security remains a high priority. Relationships with the private sector to innovate security solutions is encouraged and a competitive secondment programme to private sector Facilities Management companies has been funded by South West Region to encourage better FM relationships and more partnership solutions.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the burgeoning private health sector, clinicians and managers are digital tech design and delivery experts or business development specialists. Clinicians are encouraged to innovate and specialise at an early stage of their career and since generalist clinicians are seen as the domain of the NHS they are not encouraged or resourced by the private healthcare industry.
</p>
<p>
Companies promote a culture of elitism and competition for digital innovation in the workplace and reward behaviours that lead to winning new business or developing digital tech innovations. The recent online recruitment drive for a new generation of clinicians and managers for the South West Regional Healthcare Company described the following attributes and competencies as essential for 2035 graduate and senior staff applicants alike.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Applicants must be able to demonstrate the following -
</p>
<ul>

<li>Digital awareness, commitment to tech solutions and high level capability with a range of 3D technical design and delivery models.

<li>Personal attributes that allow comfort with competition, self-reliance, autonomy and decision making - particularly difficult decisions and those that may compromise personal values.

<li>Ability to ruthlessly focus on digital delivery tasks and targets.

<li>Ability to remain detached in relation to patient needs, to suspend compassion when required and to focus on business needs as a guiding priority. This is less about encouraging inhuman behaviour and more about ensuring that sentimentalism, moral values and subjectivity don’t get in the way of providing innovative digital services that can be accessed by as many people as can pay for it.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Being a patient in the South West in 2035</h2>


<p>
Josh is 3 and lives in Gloucestershire. Three months ago, after a bout of flu, his Mum suspected that something was amiss. Josh often wet the bed, was constantly thirsty, and was tired and irritable for weeks. Then, one morning, he collapsed. Josh’s mum was told there would be up to an hour’s wait for an ambulance and, after an initial discussion of the phone with the on-call doctor, Josh’s Mum drove him to the Accident and Emergency Department at the hospital. After investigation it was discovered that Josh had suffered from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He remained in hospital for two weeks then was referred to the general diabetes service (the specific paediatric diabetes service closed many years ago).
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Dr Donnolly, the Diabetes Consultant talked Josh’s family through what Type 1 diabetes was and how it was a lifelong condition that had to be managed constantly. Donnolly looked uneasy as he began to describe the advances in diabetes care in recent years and all the technology that was available on the market. <em>“But, none of the latest genomic treatments, or personal technologies, monitors, closed loop systems, were offered through the NHS”</em>, he explained. <em>“You could only access this kind of support privately</em>” he said. The Service had been cut back to the bone and despite the increase in Type 1 diabetes in children in the South West, the team had been greatly reduced over the years, with no dietitians. <em>“We really only offer support to families in the initial stages of diagnosis and through quarterly HbA1c tests”.</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Donnolly looked cross and explained <em>“across the South West the management of paediatric diabetes tells two stories. The data collected for those who buy the latest medical technologies in diabetes care, show the management of Type 1 diabetes is very good with little evidence of negative outcomes for patients. However, those relying on the NHS for support and outdated insulin pumps find it much harder to manage. The data for that group describes more negative outcomes in later life”.</em>
</p>
<p>
With no money available to the family and no means to buy the lastest personal technologies, Josh’s mum is worried about his future health. They begin a campaign for better state support for children with long term conditions but the first AGM is poorly attended and they abandon the campaign to focus on Josh and his care.
</p>
<h2>Workforce profile</h2>


<p>
<strong>Total workforce size in 2035:</strong> <strong>366,000. </strong>The NHS workforce has grown by around a fifth since 2025 - not nearly enough to keep pace with the complex demands presented by the South West’s growing population of older people with multiple health needs. However, the overall headcount of the health and social care workforce has grown by a somewhat larger proportion - around a quarter - mainly due to a rapid increase in the popularity of private sector healthcare provision. Once making up only a small fraction of healthcare workers in the South West, private healthcare now accounts for just over a third of health sector employment in the region whilst catering mainly to the wealthiest fifth of the population.  
</p>
<h3>Fastest growing health and social care occupation</h3>


<p>
<strong>Personal Health and Wellbeing Specialist (722% increase since 2025). </strong>The Personal Health and Wellbeing Specialist (PHWS) has become something of a symbol of the deeply divided health and social care system present in this scenario. Virtually non-existent in the early 2020s - before expanding rapidly in prevalence every year from 2024 onwards - the PHWS has become the most ubiquitous job title amongst health and social care workers employed by the one of the four main private healthcare providers now increasingly present across the South West. PHWSs are responsible for delivering the personalised care and treatment plans purchased by the growing numbers of affluent citizens who prefer not to rely on a stretched and exhausted NHS. PHWSs also generally take responsibility for monitoring the array of data arising from the wearable technology used by most private healthcare consumers, taking a preventative and proactive approach to protecting the health and wellbeing of clients should this data begin to indicate potential causes for concern.
</p>
<h3>Other key trends</h3>


<p>
One consequence of the rise in private provision has been a worsening of recruitment difficulties amongst statutory health and social care services. The better pay and conditions and the more flexible working hours on offer in the private health sector make it a tempting destination for NHS workers; private sector health workers are also more likely to be able to benefit from a variety of technological advancements (including 5G and widespread cloud computing) to do more of their work remotely, at home or at another place of their choosing.
</p>
<p>
To address staffing shortages in the state sector, efforts have been made to make it easier for workers beyond Europe to come to the UK to work for the NHS and in social care, resulting in a workforce which is more ethnically diverse and slightly younger than in decades past. However, under-investment in public services means that the thriving private health care sector remains an attractive option for these workers too, with the result that the NHS continues to have difficulty retaining a workforce of sufficient size and skill to meet the needs of the South West’s population in 2035.
</p>
<h2>Staff survey results</h2>


<ul>

<li>29% of staff are satisfied with their level of pay (down from 38% of NHS staff in 2019.)

<li>58% of staff report feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the past 12 months (40% in 2019).

<li>57% of staff feel that their manager takes a positive interest in their health and wellbeing (70% in 2019).

<li>63% often think about leaving their organisation (28% in 2019).

<li>80% have applied for digital training and career development programmes

<li>15 % have completed digital training and career development programmes

<li>60% report low moral and disinterest in work purpose
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact of Brexit on the workforce</h2>


<p>
In the immediate post-pandemic years, private healthcare firms sought to boost their workforces (and consequently the standards of care they were able to offer) by making attractive overtures to overseas workers to come and work for them. They offered levels of pay and flexible working conditions which most public health and social care services worldwide were simply unable to match in the early 2020s, with the effects of the pandemic still very severely felt across Europe and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
This helped counteract the ‘Brexit effect’ on EEA migration to the UK, whereby the supply of health and social care workers from EEA countries dried up following the 2016 referendum well in advance of Britain’s departure from the EU actually being formalised.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Consequently, net migration from EEA countries to work in health and social care in the UK actually began to steadily increase in the years following 2021, when the terms of Britain's departure from the EU were finally put into place. Still, the fact that overseas recruitment was concentrated disproportionately amongst private firms meant that the overall proportion of the South West’s NHS and social care workforce made up of workers from EEA countries steadily declined throughout the early and mid-2020s, reaching a low of just under 4% in 2027.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Since then, the UK Government has stepped up its efforts to recruit from overseas in order to plug increasingly severe shortages in the NHS and the social care sector, including by mounting advertising campaigns in EEA countries emphasising the UK’s continuing cultural similarities with Europe despite Brexit. Nonetheless, while this has had some success in increasing the flow of inwards migration, the NHS and other statutory services now face the difficulty of convincing those workers who have come from overseas to resist the temptation of taking advantage of the higher pay and standards on offer in the UK’s private healthcare sector.
</p>
<h2>The role of clinicians</h2>


<ul>

<li>Understanding that large corporations drive the development of technology and financing investment in the health sector.

<li>Increasingly, technological development manages to take over some elements of complex clinical judgement.

<li>Diagnostic skills are in less demand but they are more likely to be called in to address ‘wicked’ problems or to make agreements with patients about the next step.

<li>Doctors provide interventions in NHS settings but that is only the case in private medicine, including surgery, where robotics cannot undertake it.

<li>Research, innovation and education is more influenced by profits and corporate interests of the big tech companies. They are in the position to choose and fund research projects, and able to select the doctors or hospitals to undertake it.

<li>Big Technology companies are showing signs of adopting values that are congruent with the NHS model of providing health care.

<li>There are constant private and public conflicts between the doctors who practice in private and public systems.

<li>For NHS clinicians, there’s an increased focus on influencing skills to manage the resource available as big corporations hold more power around resource allocation than the clinical workforce themselves.
</li>

<h1>Networked Health and Care System</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
The Networked Health and Care system describes a reality in 2035 where there has been massive investment in the NHS and partnerships with the private sector. Great advances in e-health have been rolling for a decade resulting from a proliferation of cheap technologies in personal health. This is a smart, technology-led integrated health service which is networked, uses big data effectively to target treatment developments and is led by the central government. Older people are happily benefiting from cheap e-health aids and adaptations, including technology to identify early potential illness. In this world there is a net increase in the workforce through virtual health care roles, AI and a range of new specialist clinical and technology roles. Health and care needs are no longer viewed as a burden on society or a drain on public resources; health and care  needs are now viewed  as a tech design opportunity, a source of investment and ‘stage of life’ markers which are both normal and predictable.
</p>
<h2>What’s it like in 2035?</h2>


<ul>

<li>Those living in rural areas in the South West will access tech driven treatment and low cost health monitoring devices.

<li>A ‘consultation’ with a chatbot will be a routine way to raise health concerns, in the first instance

<li>Pharmacists will provide online consultations, and track medication and repeat prescriptions remotely.

<li>Investment from government and private sector as well as life sciences and clinical research and development will be closely aligned

<li>Mental ill-health of the population will be continuously scanned for using low-cost technologies monitoring sleep and mood patterns

<li>Care is distinct from health. Human and relational aspects of care are now the domain of ‘Community People’, a successful South West regional social enterprise that is commissioned alongside technical services as needed, with the aim of supporting communication, isolation and socio/mental wellbeing in what is now a technical health industry.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A view from 2035</h2>


<p>
<strong>Today in 2035, </strong>the NHS is a national, technology-driven and networked system of care and the South West benefits greatly. Since the Pandemic Inquiry of 2022, government have invested heavily to create world class care for major health problems for everyone across the South West, including the prevention of heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases, providing education and exercise programmes to tens of thousands more patients with heart problems, preventing premature deaths and saving many more lives each year by diagnosing more cancers early. Addiction services have been shored up through new tech driven responses to monitoring and behaviour change and the link between MH, addiction and physical health has been prioritised as a diagnostic service with early warning signals based on annual physical online checks.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Politically, it was finally realised after the pandemic of 2020/21 that under investment year-on-year to meet growing demand could not go on forever. Something had to give. Brexit gave the government confidence to act, to negotiate multi-million pound deals with private health care providers and to be unapologetic about the often commented upon UK mindset of exceptionalism which became increasingly harnessed as a driver for future success on the global digital health care stage.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The biggest and most radical development in health care over the last fifteen years has been the government-backed scheme to ensure that all citizens have their genome sequenced and since 2030 this has meant that clinicians can target the most effective treatments for their patients. The dual focus on precision treatment of disease and more tailored health promotion is prolonging healthy lives. <em>“Personalised medicine for the masses”</em> as one newspaper headline described it 2029.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
First talked about in the Covid Care Act of 2022, the opening of the National Health Information Technology Centre in Manchester in 2028 was seen as a driving force in shifting towards the effective use of big data. Funded by government and private finance, population health data is constantly collected, analysed and shared across the regions, transforming health care, informing clinical research and protecting the public. Sharing of information at a local and national level, between government and the private sector and between patients and providers has enabled this connected, intelligent system to work. Whilst online security walls are now highly sophisticated and security protocols are now policed by the new Global Web force, nevertheless occasional breaches in confidentiality and data protection do happen. But society has become used to this side effect of what is an otherwise welcomed sense of global interconnectivity,such that private insurance to protect against identity fraud and data attacks is now a mandatory clause in all home insurance policies.
</p>
<p>
A decade of breakthroughs in machine-learning have had a profound impact on how people are diagnosed and treated in the South West. Clinicians have access to more data than ever about the patients they serve, with virtually all citizens regularly capturing and sharing their monitoring data through smart phones and other devices as they work, rest and play. Clinicians can immediately access all previous scans and test results on any patient under their care, wherever they are.
</p>
<p>
Digital health profiles are now held for every citizen in the South West and are shaped by both clinical interactions, tests etc and lifestyle choices as captured by an increasingly digitally enhanced society e.g. through QR codes in restaurants and online shopping. Social inclusion has become a strategic driver for change both politically and economically as the social and monetary cost of exclusion post pandemic threatened to overwhelm public services in the late 2020’s. Today, ‘Commissioning from the Margins’ a new NHS programme to collaborate with marginalised individuals and groups has become an established strand of the SW digital strategy, ensuring that previously marginalised communities are able to engage fully with the opportunities of the digital reform of health care.
</p>
<p>
In 2035 a pilot scheme to insert digital transmitters into human fingers finally achieved ethical approval and the South West became a first wave test group. This allows huge amounts of medical and lifestyle data to be captured through a simple digital data recorder inserted under the skin which is activated when it connects with approved Bluetooth signals from companies and services who have joined the scheme. The incentives to join the scheme are very attractive and the pilots have all been overwhelmed with demand meaning that a broad range of data capture is becoming possible. The social contract between individuals and data analyst companies has now shifted to an acceptance of the intrusion of online marketing and data profiling as the price to be paid for personalised products and wellbeing resources alongside the additional income source that data transmitters generate for health and social care provision through advertising contracts.
</p>
<p>
All this data is sent to the National Health Information Technology Centre. M-care has been rolled out across the South West including to patients with terminal cancer and life-limiting conditions. To ensure wide uptake everyone over 75 became eligible for free wifi from 2025. However, the Devon-based <em>Cancer Support</em> Charity, has criticised the lack of adequate emotional support and advice to help people cope with the side effects of drugs, meet wider needs and come to terms with their condition.
</p>
<p>
Communities across the South West have reported for many years that people feel more socially isolated, lacking human contact but others find it easier to navigate all the online options for health care.
</p>
<p>
The recent introduction of human digital transmitters has caused some concern in the community, not least because of the payment incentives offered to trial volunteers but most people, when asked, are positive about the data collection advances and want to be part of contributing to new science - a legacy from the multiple trial and ONS survey participation of the general public in 2021.
</p>
<p>
Patient leaders groups and experts by experience have seen an upsurge of membership as individuals seek out others with similar experience to connect with at a human level. Funding for virtual lived experience groups and chat rooms has been expanded and some local fundraising for face-to-face groups has allowed people to meet in person to share experiences. Experts by experience training are now focused on enabling access to IT and contributing to discussions in a virtual meeting environment.
</p>
<p>
The experience of children going to school in the South West is dramatically different from what it was, even a decade ago. Augmented reality and AI have also made children’s and young people’s learning experiences in schools, colleges, universities more interactive and accessible.
</p>
<p>
Today demand for MH services continues to be a significant consequence of the covid pandemic. To meet this demand, South West innovators met at Dartington Hall in 2023 to review the response of psychiatrists to traumatised service personnel after the first world war. They drew on the Northfield experiments which established therapeutic communities for people in distress and designed, at scale, Virtual Therapeutic Communities Plan for the South West population. The plan has begun implementation this year following an investment of £6 million for 3 years from Central Government and includes the offer of 3 x 3 day in person stays per year at the beautiful Dartington Hall. The 3 day stay enables people with MH difficulties to form a therapeutic community with 10 other people and is facilitated by a group therapist. The therapeutic community then meets virtually every week with the same group therapist for the rest of the year. Members of the Therapeutic communities already report high levels of satisfaction and improved wellbeing from this blend of in person and virtual work.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Covid Care Act</em></strong> of 2022 set out a legislative framework to support the NHS deal with the yearly threat and pressures from new strains of Covid. That laid the way for mass investment in research and development and unprecedented use of technology. At the time, some commentators argued that the government was providing a legal framework for the NHS to sell personal data of millions.
</p>
<p>
3D printing and virtual simulations create ways for patients to improve the personalisation, quality and safety of treatment and patient experience. 3D printing also offers faster prototypes and the creation of personalised prosthetics.
</p>
<p>
The government has invested heavily in low-cost technology and helps support those with complex or chronic conditions who are often prescribed mobile phones with pre-loaded apps to meet their assessed needs. There was a rash early on of cheap apps being available purporting to provide quality healthcare, but which resulted in many cases of worsening health and in some cases death due to inappropriate self-care. There is now a kitemark governing approved apps. These apps provide relevant medical information, lifestyle advice and links to peer groups and other community-based groups to combat social exclusion. It is now standard practice for patients to wear monitoring type technologies. Smart homes and sensors are popular and the promise of a good standard of care, without extortionate premiums or taxpayer burden, is enough to offset any of the doubts that people may have about their data being shared.
</p>
<p>
Today, physically ‘seeing’ the doctor, however, is something that patients still do. There are also a myriad of other ways in which the patient can make contact with those providing health advice and guidance. Personalised messaging is not uncommon.
</p>
<p>
Clinicians find themselves having closer relationships with large companies more than ever before, with corporate players including those developing pharmacy and other health care technologies offering close working relationships with NHS hospitals, doctors and other medical professionals.
</p>
<p>
Looking back, it is the successful roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 to the elderly and at-risk which is seen as marking a step-change in attitudes towards illness, age and technology. The vaccine - and its rapid deployment to those who most needed it - was soon seen as representing the ultimate triumph of human ingenuity in the form of technological breakthrough over seemingly intractable problems of illness and morbidity. The exhilaration and sense of achievement that followed drove the governments that followed to invest hugely in research and development aimed at tackling the other major sources of death and ill-health of our time, including cancer, dementia and heart disease - paving the way for the breakthroughs in mass genome sequencing which have radically altered the nature of health care in the South West by 2035.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, many of the South West’s elderly citizens today feel a huge sense of gratitude towards younger generations both for the sacrifices they made during the pandemic era, and for their key role in bringing about the networked healthcare system responsible for prolonging the lives of so many today. The South West - including in relatively less affluent areas such as Torbay and Plymouth - has an increasingly burgeoning population of nonagenarians; these people were in at least their mid-70s at the time of pandemic, and still remember vividly the sense of terror and despair they felt during the darkest hours of 2020 and 2021. Since then, however, life for the elderly has been made progressively less scary and more dignified, thanks in large part to the accumulated impacts of one technological advance after another, as well as investment in care and mental health services since the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
That is not to say that absolutely everyone is delighted with the state of the South West’s health and social care services in 2035. Some residents - young and old - feel that euphoria over the vaccine and subsequent technological breakthroughs has overshadowed what should have been the main lesson of the pandemic, namely the heroic efforts of health and social care workers and the vital importance of more traditional, ‘human’ care work. Some feel one of the main negative impacts of the pandemic in the long-term has been an inadvertent decline in the prevalence of face-to-face care - with some elderly citizens finding predominately virtual means of communication to be insufficient when it comes to staving off loneliness.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, however, most of the South West’s younger and working-age population in 2035 feel just as satisfied and grateful regarding the networked healthcare system as the majority of the elderly do. Those with chronic conditions are already aware of the benefits of the wide array of app-based and remote support now available; others, meanwhile, look forward to a future in which they too can experience the benefits of longer lives, and feel confident that they will be able to experience a high standard of care without this entailing excessive costs for themselves or for their loved ones.
</p>
<p>
One universally-acknowledged benefit of the growth of the networked healthcare system has been a diminution in the risk of a novel viral infection wrecking anywhere near the same level of societal destruction and harm as did Covid-19 fifteen years ago. Firstly, NHS trusts and other providers across the South West now possess large stockpiles of smart PPE, aspects of which including breathability can be tweaked remotely depending on the precise nature of the infection being dealt with; leaders are confident that this would help greatly reduce transmission amongst health and social care staff in any future epidemic. Secondly, the prevalence of networked, health-related technology across the majority of homes in the South West has the potential, experts believe, to form the basis of a highly effective track and trace system should the need for one arise.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, scientists now feel certain that we possess the capacity to develop, test and deploy across the whole region an mRNA vaccine within a matter of weeks of any new pathogen emerging; a combination of confidence and technological capability which is emblematic of the transformed, networked healthcare system of 2035 in this scenario.
</p>
<h2>The role of leadership</h2>


<p>
In 2035 leaders are recruited, trained and rewarded for technical capability, ingenuity, networking skills and ability to work with detail and nuance. Communication skills are highly valued and musicians, linguists and mathematicians are often attracted into new health care roles as the required capabilities often suit the personality traits and attributes of these groups.
</p>
<p>
Clinical leaders are now trained in high spec digital skills and medical schools have by and large joined forces with IT and design companies to develop a curriculum based on product design and digital services.
</p>
<p>
Managers are few and far between as teams tend to work autonomously and on a project basis since most care happens in a virtual environment and alerts are mostly digital rather than in person. Managers are trained as super style administrators, often with only one or two staff employed to run large services. All managers now work from home as office space has become redundant in a digital environment. Staff training tends to be based on digital organizing procedures and personal wellbeing to mitigate the potential isolation.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Groups of clinicians now work in laboratories with digital experts to collaborate on digital health solutions and as a result team working, collaboration and influencing skills are highly valued and rewarded. All graduate clinicians are exposed to a year in one of the top ten digital healthcare industry leaders before they are licensed to practice as clinicians. Many doctors take elective years and take study abroad semesters to broaden their exposure to global trends. The UK also benefits from the global transfer of digital thought leadership and the South West workforce is a diverse multi-lingual community of specialists.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The University of Exeter expanded its  North  campus in 2028 and by 2035 is a global leader in environmental science and digital healthcare. The expansion into digital health allowed Exeter University to build on its existing top 10 research university status and combine its pre-existing conservation and environmental reputation with a new-found expertise in digital health care. This positioned the university as a leader in two of the most contemporaneous issues globally. Applications for undergraduates and post graduate courses soared. In collaboration with the Business school, a new Future Leaders programme has been established in 2030, jointly delivered with Ashridge in the UK and Harvard in the US. Graduates of the programme are regularly headhunted for top industry roles across the world.

<h2>Being a patient in the South West in 2035</h2>


<p>
Josh is 3 and lives in Gloucestershire. Three months ago, after a bout of flu, his Mum suspected that something was amiss. She books an online consultation with a GP who advises her to buy a disposable blood glucose monitor from the chemist. It was a good spot. His blood sugar levels were over 20. Josh has Type 1 diabetes.
</p>
<p>
Josh spends some time in hospital to bring his diabetes under control. With the diabetes nurse, the family then has an online consultation with a specialist in London. He talks through the option of stem cell treatment for Josh. It’s not a permanent fix, they are told but human stem cells can be turned into insulin-producing beta cells within the pancreas. That would begin to work over the first two weeks and would last for a year. At that point, similar treatment could be given.
</p>
<p>
Josh’s Mum looks relieved something can be done and agrees to go through the e-diabetes learning package and if she is happy, an appointment for Josh to travel to London for initial stem cell treatment within the month will be arranged electronically.
</p>
<h2>Workforce profile</h2>


<p>
Running through centralised data centres, workforce planning insights are continually generated for each region of England. Workforce planners benefit from this intelligence
</p>
<p>
and plan for the ever-changing short term, medium term and long-term requirements.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Analysis is undertaken by artificial intelligence or specialists and given to doctors to interpret data. The volume of data interpretation has heavily increased and is an ever-important core skill of clinicians who use it to enhance bespoke patient care.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Total workforce size in 2035: 360,000. </strong>The health and social care workforce has grown by just over a fifth in this scenario. While past studies had projected that services would require more staff than this to keep up with rising demand, the range of technological advances which have been successfully implemented in practice in the decade leading up to 2035 - such as, for example, the routine use of intelligent chatbots for initial consultations - have helped create a sense that levels of recruitment are indeed proving sufficient to meet the needs of people in the South West.
</p>
<h3>Fastest growing health and social care occupation</h3>


<p>
<strong>Innovation and Research Practitioner (322% increase since 2025). </strong>Initially a somewhat niche role, by 2035 there are several thousand Innovation and Research Practitioners (IRPs) working in the South West. Their job is to ensure the services on the ground make successful practical application of the many data- and network-driven innovations developed by researchers at institutions such as the National Health Information Technology Centre. IRPs also play a key role in helping other parts of the workforce, including nurses and care workers, get to grips with new, tech-driven aspects of service provision such as m-Care. The role of the IRP therefore requires a blend of both clinical knowledge and data-related expertise with sufficient personal and communication skills. This enables IRPs to act as a bridge between more traditional health and social care workers and the newer, specialist additions to the workforce in areas such as AI and virtual health care.
</p>
<h3>Other key trends</h3>


<p>
Overall, the various technological innovations put into practice since the early 2020s have had the effect of causing an overall decline in the levels of face-to-face contact experienced by many health and social care workers; both with patients (due in part to the rise in use of virtual consultations and of app-driven personal monitoring techniques) and with colleagues (due in large part to the adoption of remote working for most administrative aspects of health and social care work). While most workers recognise the benefits of many recent changes and express higher levels of satisfaction with pay levels than they have for several decades, some regret the loss of the ‘human aspect’ across much of modern healthcare, and feel physically isolated to a degree they would once never have thought likely in this field of work.
</p>
<p>
In addition to this, the need for doctors, nurses and care workers to regularly take part in training and digital upskilling exercises to maintain their capabilities regarding the newer, tech-driven aspects of their jobs has led to a sense of resentment amongst some (particularly older) members of the workforce. They believe that many of these innovations simply complicate their efforts to provide high-quality care. Some feel that the new additions to the workforce in research and development - often younger, and with backgrounds in natural science rather than on the ground in hospitals or in providing care - are too keen to push for the rapid implementation of new innovations before considering the full range of impacts they will have for healthcare workers and patients as a whole.
</p>
<h2>Staff survey results</h2>


<ul>

<li>53% of staff are satisfied with their level of pay (up from 38% of NHS staff in 2019.)

<li>21% of staff report feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the past 12 months (40% in 2019).

<li>75% of staff feel that their manager takes a positive interest in their health and wellbeing (70% in 2019).

<li>15% often think about leaving their organisation (28% in 2019).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact of Brexit on the workforce</h2>


<p>
By 2035, it is generally recognised that Brexit exacerbated workforce shortages in the South West’s health and social care sector up until the early 2020s, with a growth in negative perceptions of the UK on the continent reducing the desire of EEA residents to work and live here. However, Britain’s success in delivering the first round of Covid vaccines to its citizens in 2021 (particularly in comparison to most EU countries) marked the beginning of a turnaround in the views of the UK amongst Europeans. Following the huge investments in public health and health-related research and development from the early 2020s onwards, this shift in perceptions gathered pace: today in 2035, most post-Brexit resentment towards the UK in Europe has been replaced by a sense of admiration (and even envy) for its innovative, dynamic and successful networked health and social care sector.
</p>
<p>
This is partly the result of the high levels of cross-border collaboration involved in the work that goes on at institutions such as the National Health Information Technology Centre. Here, the work of European researchers is absolutely critical: the sustained post-Covid boom in remote and Zoom-based working has made collaboration between scientists of different nationalities more prevalent than ever before, regardless of whether they reside in the UK or elsewhere. The close involvement of European academics, scientists, and researchers in helping develop the technical advances now put into practice in the networked healthcare system has led many to feel more of a connection to the UK, despite increasing regulatory divergence between the UK and EU in fields such as agriculture. The French Health Ministry even recently produced a paper utilising the UK as a positive case study in making the case for public investment in health-related research and development to become a higher proportion of the EU’s budget.
</p>
<p>
Workers from EEA countries are now more likely to be found in the South West in the new, data-related roles in the sector rather than in more traditional health and social care occupations. The overall proportion of workers in the NHS and social care services in the South West who are from EEA countries has recovered since its post-Brexit nadir in 2022: this proportion has now been steady at around 7% for several years, an increase of around 1% since the time of the referendum.
</p>
<h2>The role of clinicians</h2>


<ul>

<li>Lead clinicians have a deep understanding of patient’s needs and how these interplay with the technical environment.

<li>Doctors provide an important bridge between the technologically driven service and the care that patients need.

<li>Doctors need a high degree of emotional intelligence to support patients with complex data about risk factors and to help them make difficult decisions.

<li>There is an increased emphasis on the development of technical skills to manipulate data and communicate risk effectively, alongside supporting self-care.

<li>Clinicians’ roles emphasise the analysis being undertaken by Artificial Intelligence or specialists and given to doctors to interpret.

<li>The volume of data interpretation is heavily increased and used to enhance bespoke patient care.

<li>Global training programmes allow free movement across countries, effectively distributing the workforce.

<li>There would be an opportunity to make better use of technology to increase monitoring of the workforce to take breaks and introduce smarter rostering to improve shift planning.

<li>There is less intense working due to more algorithm-based diagnosis.

<li>Clinical teams have developed extensive understanding of moving resources (physical and virtual) around the system Specialists are delivering services from a distance and at scale, for example, patient care and delivering training, as well as increased use of remote medicine (telemedicine).
</li>
